# MyToken Contract

## Overview
This Solidity smart contract implements a basic token with functionalities for minting and burning tokens.

## Token Details
- **Token Name:** [Your Token Name]
- **Token Symbol:** [Your Token Symbol]
- **Initial Supply:** [Initial Supply Amount]

## Functions

### `mint(address _to, uint256 _value) public`
Mints `_value` tokens and assigns them to the address `_to`.

### `burn(address _from, uint256 _value) public`
Destroys `_value` tokens from the balance of `_from`, reducing the total supply accordingly.

## Usage
To deploy and interact with this contract:
1. Compile the contract using a Solidity compiler (e.g., Remix).
2. Deploy the contract to an Ethereum blockchain (e.g., using Remix or a local development environment like Ganache).
3. Use a wallet or contract interaction tool (e.g., Remix, MetaMask) to mint and burn tokens as needed.
